This simple app based on the [Salesforce MobileSDK for iOS](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS) allows Salesforce Foundation users to:

- Browse your recently viewed Activities so that you might easily share, checkin, or clone them
- Peruse forthcoming volunteer activities to find activities you'd enjoy
- Review your participation in activities
- Check in at volunteer activities
- get directions to volunteer activities (assuming the Activity address is complete)
- Post Activities to Chatter, inviting others to join you
- Email Activities to your coworkers so that they can join you
- Clone Activities so that you can easily recreate repeating volunteer activities
